# Terraform Boilerplate for Azure (local)

This is a boilerplate project for Terraform that is configured to work with Azure. The project is configured to work with a local Terraform installation.

## Getting Started

1. Create an `*.auto.tfvars` (e.g. `myvars.auto.tfvars`) file in the `src` directory of the project. This file should contain all the variables that are required for the project. The variables should be defined in the `variables.tf` file.
